## How to contribute

We're always looking for contributions that improve Cachet. It's easy to get started and you don't even need to know how to write a single line of code!

### Contributing as a non-developer/non-designer

We're always looking for new [translations](#translations).

Of course bug reports, feature requests and [documentation](https://docs.cachethq.io) are always appreciated.

### Contributing as a designer

As Cachet gains new features, the design and ideas that were once a perfect fit need updating and in some cases designing from scratch. This is where you come in! Fancy giving Cachet a lick of paint? Sweet!

You'll need to install Node.js, Bower and Gulp.

To get started you can do the following:

1. Install Node.js and our dev dependencies.
2. Make your changes to the SCSS files in `./resources/assets/sass/`
3. Run `gulp`

If you're making a lot of changes, you'll find that running `gulp watch` will make life easier for you!

### Contributing as a developer

Built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

We use these extra dependencies to develop Cachet:

- Node.js
- Gulp
- Git

Once cloned to your local machine, you'll need some demo data! Run `php artisan cachet:seed` to get the demo installation on the go.

## Installation, Upgrades and Documentation
